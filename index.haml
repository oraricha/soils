					%h3 Groundwater protecting from pollution hazard
					%p 
						%strong Minimization subsurface pollution 
						depends on reliable and effective monitoring programs. 
						Today, most groundwater monitoring programs are based on observation wells. Consequently, identification of 
						pollutants in groundwater is clear evidence that contaminants already crossed the entire vadose-zone and 
						accumulated in the aquifer. Unfortunately, only little can be done to fully remediate contaminated aquifers. 
						Therefore effective monitoring program that aims at protecting groundwater from pollution must include vadose-zone 
						monitoring technologies. 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology provide 
						%strong "early warning" 
						on contamination processes 
						in the vadose zone long before aquifer contamination turns evident.

					%h3 Earthen dam stability
					%p 
						Water infiltration through earthen dams may weaken 
						its stability and potentially lead to dam breach. Today most monitoring programs 
						in earthen dams are bases on measurement of the phreatic level in piezometers. 
						Nevertheless detection of free water in well indicates undesired saturation of the dam sediment. 
						Application of 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology in earthen dams provides 
						%strong Real time 
						continuous information on the dam sediment moisture. 
						Detailed analysis moisture data obtained by the 
						%strong VMS 
						across the dam is used to provide 
						%strong early warning 
						on potential weakening of the dam stability.

					%h3 Optimization of Remediation Strategies
					%p 
						%strong In-situ bio-remediation 
						of contaminated vadose 
						zone is dependent on the ability to implement hydraulic 
						and chemical conditions that promote development of specific degrading 
						bacteria in deep sections of the subsurface. Implementation of the 
						%strong VMS 
						in sites that undergoes active remediation provides real time information on 
						the actual chemical and hydrological conditions in the vadose zone as the 
						remediation process progresses. The VMS data allows real time assessment of the 
						remediation strategies through direct feedback from the subsurface. 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology provides unique tools of proper 
						%strong management 
						of remediated sites.

					%h3 Heap-leach mining
					%p 
						%strong Heap leaching mining typically involve leaching of 
						crushed ore with diluted acid solution, using irrigation system 
						such as sprinklers or drippers. Upon percolation of the leaching solvent in the ore 
						heap metal oxides dissolve and drain down to the bottom of the heap. As a result the 
						drained solution is enriched with the desired metal which is than processes from the 
						metal bearing solution. Water percolation through the ore heap take place in 
						unsaturated condition and derived by gravity and capillary forces. 
						Implementation of 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology in active heap leach pad provides the pad managers with 
						real time information the leaching efficiency. Data collected by the 
						%strong VMS 
						allows direct measurements of the water flow velocities and measure the chemical evolution 
						of the percolating solvent in the unsaturated ore. As result the solvent application cycles 
						may be managed according to the actual chemical evolution of the percolating water in the heap 
						in order to increase mineral extraction efficiency.

						%h4 Dynamics of flood-water infiltration and groundwater recharge
						%p
							Dynamics of flood-water infiltration and groundwater recharge was investigated using Vadose zone Monitoring systems which were installed under stream bed of ephemeral rivers and reservoirs. Data that was collected by the VMS during each flood enabled direct calculation of the percolation  flow velocities and infiltration fluxes.

						%h4 Optimization of Remediation Conditions using Vadose Zone Monitoring Technology
						%p A vadose zone monitoring system that was installed under a gas station allowed accurate monitoring of the impact of remediation activities on the subsurface hydraulic and chemical conditions including: (1) temporal variation of the sediment water content, and (2) chemical and isotopic composition of the percolating water. Results from each wetting cycles were used to improve the following wetting cycles in order to optimize the vadose zone conditions for microbial degradation of BTEX while minimizing leaching of contaminants to the groundwater.

						%h4 Bioremediation of perchlorate in deep vadose zone
						%p A study on enhance the biodegradation of perchlorate in the deep vadose zone was conducted through pilot scale experiment in a site that is heavily contaminated by perchlorate. Monitoring of the direct impact of enhanced percolation on the actual hydraulic and chemical conditions in the vadose zone was achieved using a vadose zone monitoring system (VMS) which measured continuously the vadose zone water content and allowed frequent sampling of the sediment pore water across the entire vadose zone of the site (40 m).

						%h4 Land use impact on groundwater quality
						%p Land use impact on groundwater quality was investigated using Vadose zone Monitoring Systems which were installed across the vadose zone underlying various agricultural, urban and industrial setups. The quality and quantity of the percolating water was measured continuously over several years and provided an early warning to potential pollution of groundwater by the various land uses.
