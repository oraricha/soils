							Sensoil’s vadose zone monitoring system 
							%strong (VMS) 
							provides
							%strong "early warning" 
							on contamination processes 
							in the vadose zone long before aquifer contamination turns evident.

					%p.technology
						%strong Minimization subsurface pollution 
						depends on reliable and effective monitoring programs. 
						Today, most groundwater monitoring programs are based on observation wells. Consequently, identification of 
						pollutants in groundwater is clear evidence that contaminants already crossed the entire vadose-zone and 
						accumulated in the aquifer. Unfortunately, only little can be done to fully remediate contaminated aquifers. 
						Therefore effective monitoring program that aims at protecting groundwater from pollution must include vadose-zone 
						monitoring technologies.

							monitoring system 
							%strong VMS 
							can provide the operators and management with
							%strong real time 
							information about the 
							%strong leaching and mineral production efficiency. 
							Data collected by the

							allows direct measurements of the water flow velocities and measure the chemical evolution of the percolating solvent in the unsaturated ore.

					%p.technology 
						%strong Heap leaching mining typically involve leaching of 
						crushed ore with diluted acid solution, using irrigation system 
						such as sprinklers or drippers. Upon percolation of the leaching solvent in the ore 
						heap metal oxides dissolve and drain down to the bottom of the heap. As a result the 
						drained solution is enriched with the desired metal which is than processes from the 
						metal bearing solution. Water percolation through the ore heap take place in 
						unsaturated condition and derived by gravity and capillary forces. 
						Implementation of 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology in active heap leach pad provides the pad managers with 
						real time information the leaching efficiency. Data collected by the 
						%strong VMS 
						allows direct measurements of the water flow velocities and measure the chemical evolution 
						of the percolating solvent in the unsaturated ore. As result the solvent application cycles 
						may be managed according to the actual chemical evolution of the percolating water in the heap 
						in order to increase mineral extraction efficiency.
