					%h3 Groundwater protecting from pollution hazard
					%p 
						%strong Minimization subsurface pollution 
						depends on reliable and effective monitoring programs. 
						Today, most groundwater monitoring programs are based on observation wells. Consequently, identification of 
						pollutants in groundwater is clear evidence that contaminants already crossed the entire vadose-zone and 
						accumulated in the aquifer. Unfortunately, only little can be done to fully remediate contaminated aquifers. 
						Therefore effective monitoring program that aims at protecting groundwater from pollution must include vadose-zone 
						monitoring technologies. 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology provide 
						%strong "early warning" 
						on contamination processes 
						in the vadose zone long before aquifer contamination turns evident.

					%h3 Earthen dam stability
					%p 
						Water infiltration through earthen dams may weaken 
						its stability and potentially lead to dam breach. Today most monitoring programs 
						in earthen dams are bases on measurement of the phreatic level in piezometers. 
						Nevertheless detection of free water in well indicates undesired saturation of the dam sediment. 
						Application of 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology in earthen dams provides 
						%strong Real time 
						continuous information on the dam moisture. 
						Detailed analysis data obtained by the 
						%strong VMS 
						is used to provide 
						%strong early warning 
						on potential weakening of the dam stability.

					%h3 Optimization of Remediation Strategies
					%p 
						%strong In-situ bio-remediation 
						of contaminated vadose 
						zone is dependent on the ability to implement hydraulic 
						and chemical conditions that promote development of specific degrading 
						bacteria in deep sections of the subsurface. Implementation of the 
						%strong VMS 
						in sites that undergoes active remediation provides real time information on 
						the actual chemical and hydrological conditions in the vadose zone as the 
						remediation process progresses. The VMS data allows real time assessment of the 
						remediation strategies through direct feedback from the subsurface. 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology provides unique tools of proper 
						%strong management 
						of remediated sites.

					%h3 Heap-leach mining
					%p 
						%strong Heap leaching mining typically involve leaching of 
						crushed ore with diluted acid or cyanide solution, using irrigation system 
						such as sprinklers or drippers. Upon percolation of the leaching solvent in the ore 
						heap metal oxides dissolve and drain down to the bottom of the heap. As a result the 
						drained solution is enriched with the desired metal which is than processes from the 
						metal bearing pregnant solution. Water percolation through the ore heap take place in 
						unsaturated condition and derived by gravity and capillary forces. 
						Implementation of 
						%strong Sensoil 
						monitoring technology in active heap leach pad provides the pad managers with 
						real time information the leaching efficiency. Data collected by the 
						%strong VMS 
						allows direct measurements of the water flow velocities and measure the chemical evolution 
						of the percolating solvent in the unsaturated ore. As result the solvent application cycles 
						may be managed according to the actual chemical evolution of the percolating water in the heap 
						in order to increase mineral extraction efficiency.

					%h3 About
					%p 
						Our disruptive technology enables detecting water percolation and contaminations migration, transport in the subsurface. 
						We offer a new horizon in understanding the previously unseen subsurface below us. Our solutions to various fields provide a real time picture, cost and time efficient solutions for areas once based only on models or highly expensive less efficient testing.
						SenSoil’s VMSTM system  allows real time, continuous tracking of water percolation and contaminant transport process in deep sections of the Vadose zone (unsaturated sediments), from land surface to groundwater. It applied for detection, monitoring and optimization of remediation strategies, warning based continues monitoring of earthen dams moisture, monitoring and indicating of optimum growth conditions for agriculture and offers a substantial cost and efficiency improvement in Mine Heap Leaching process efficiency. 
					%p 
						Our technology is based on more than 10 years of research lead by 
						%strong Dr. Ofer Dahan 
						in Ben Gurion University (Israel) and Nevada University (USA) and two patents. Sensoil’d technology  was applied worldwide in over 20 working installations.

						%strong Dr. Ofer Dahan 
						the inventor of the VMS, tenure holder in the Department of Environmental Hydrology and Microbiology at Ben Gurion University of the Negev. Dr. Dahan is a specialist in the field vadose zone and groundwater Hydrology, his extensive knowledge in both fields lead to the development of the VMS. His research covers a wide range of studies on water flow and contaminant transport in the subsurface, including: flood water infiltration from streams and reservoirs, interactive bioremediation of contaminated vadose zone and land use impact on groundwater quality
