          <h3>Groundwater protecting from pollution hazard</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Minimization subsurface pollution</strong>
            depends on reliable and effective monitoring programs.
            Today, most groundwater monitoring programs are based on observation wells. Consequently, identification of
            pollutants in groundwater is clear evidence that contaminants already crossed the entire vadose-zone and
            accumulated in the aquifer. Unfortunately, only little can be done to fully remediate contaminated aquifers.
            Therefore effective monitoring program that aims at protecting groundwater from pollution must include vadose-zone
            monitoring technologies.
            <strong>Sensoil</strong>
            monitoring technology provide
            <strong>"early warning"</strong>
            on contamination processes
            in the vadose zone long before aquifer contamination turns evident.

          <h3>Earthen dam stability</h3>
          <p>
            Water infiltration through earthen dams may weaken
            its stability and potentially lead to dam breach. Today most monitoring programs
            in earthen dams are bases on measurement of the phreatic level in piezometers.
            Nevertheless detection of free water in well indicates undesired saturation of the dam sediment.
            Application of
            <strong>Sensoil</strong>
            monitoring technology in earthen dams provides
            <strong>Real time</strong>
            continuous information on the dam moisture.
            Detailed analysis data obtained by the
            <strong>VMS</strong>
            is used to provide
            <strong>early warning</strong>
            on potential weakening of the dam stability.

          <h3>Optimization of Remediation Strategies</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>In-situ bio-remediation</strong>
            of contaminated vadose
            zone is dependent on the ability to implement hydraulic
            and chemical conditions that promote development of specific degrading
            bacteria in deep sections of the subsurface. Implementation of the
            <strong>VMS</strong>
            in sites that undergoes active remediation provides real time information on
            the actual chemical and hydrological conditions in the vadose zone as the
            remediation process progresses. The VMS data allows real time assessment of the
            remediation strategies through direct feedback from the subsurface.
            <strong>Sensoil</strong>
            monitoring technology provides unique tools of proper
            <strong>management</strong>
            of remediated sites.

          <h3>Heap-leach mining</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Heap leaching mining typically involve leaching of</strong>
            crushed ore with diluted acid or cyanide solution, using irrigation system
            such as sprinklers or drippers. Upon percolation of the leaching solvent in the ore
            heap metal oxides dissolve and drain down to the bottom of the heap. As a result the
            drained solution is enriched with the desired metal which is than processes from the
            metal bearing pregnant solution. Water percolation through the ore heap take place in
            unsaturated condition and derived by gravity and capillary forces.
            Implementation of
            <strong>Sensoil</strong>
            monitoring technology in active heap leach pad provides the pad managers with
            real time information the leaching efficiency. Data collected by the
            <strong>VMS</strong>
            allows direct measurements of the water flow velocities and measure the chemical evolution
            of the percolating solvent in the unsaturated ore. As result the solvent application cycles
            may be managed according to the actual chemical evolution of the percolating water in the heap
            in order to increase mineral extraction efficiency.
