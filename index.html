          <h3>Groundwater protecting from pollution hazard</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Minimization subsurface pollution</strong>
            depends on reliable and effective monitoring programs.
            Today, most groundwater monitoring programs are based on observation wells. Consequently, identification of
            pollutants in groundwater is clear evidence that contaminants already crossed the entire vadose-zone and
            accumulated in the aquifer. Unfortunately, only little can be done to fully remediate contaminated aquifers.
            Therefore effective monitoring program that aims at protecting groundwater from pollution must include vadose-zone
            monitoring technologies.
            <strong>Sensoil</strong>
            monitoring technology provide
            <strong>"early warning"</strong>
            on contamination processes
            in the vadose zone long before aquifer contamination turns evident.

          <h3>Earthen dam stability</h3>
          <p>
            Water infiltration through earthen dams may weaken
            its stability and potentially lead to dam breach. Today most monitoring programs
            in earthen dams are bases on measurement of the phreatic level in piezometers.
            Nevertheless detection of free water in well indicates undesired saturation of the dam sediment.
            Application of
            <strong>Sensoil</strong>
            monitoring technology in earthen dams provides
            <strong>Real time</strong>
            continuous information on the dam sediment moisture.
            Detailed analysis moisture data obtained by the
            <strong>VMS</strong>
            across the dam is used to provide
            <strong>early warning</strong>
            on potential weakening of the dam stability.

          <h3>Optimization of Remediation Strategies</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>In-situ bio-remediation</strong>
            of contaminated vadose
            zone is dependent on the ability to implement hydraulic
            and chemical conditions that promote development of specific degrading
            bacteria in deep sections of the subsurface. Implementation of the
            <strong>VMS</strong>
            in sites that undergoes active remediation provides real time information on
            the actual chemical and hydrological conditions in the vadose zone as the
            remediation process progresses. The VMS data allows real time assessment of the
            remediation strategies through direct feedback from the subsurface.
            <strong>Sensoil</strong>
            monitoring technology provides unique tools of proper
            <strong>management</strong>
            of remediated sites.

          <h3>Heap-leach mining</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Heap leaching mining typically involve leaching of</strong>
            crushed ore with diluted acid solution, using irrigation system
            such as sprinklers or drippers. Upon percolation of the leaching solvent in the ore
            heap metal oxides dissolve and drain down to the bottom of the heap. As a result the
            drained solution is enriched with the desired metal which is than processes from the
            metal bearing solution. Water percolation through the ore heap take place in
            unsaturated condition and derived by gravity and capillary forces.
            Implementation of
            <strong>Sensoil</strong>
            monitoring technology in active heap leach pad provides the pad managers with
            real time information the leaching efficiency. Data collected by the
            <strong>VMS</strong>
            allows direct measurements of the water flow velocities and measure the chemical evolution
            of the percolating solvent in the unsaturated ore. As result the solvent application cycles
            may be managed according to the actual chemical evolution of the percolating water in the heap
            in order to increase mineral extraction efficiency.

            <h4>Dynamics of flood-water infiltration and groundwater recharge</h4>
            <p>
              Dynamics of flood-water infiltration and groundwater recharge was investigated using Vadose zone Monitoring systems which were installed under stream bed of ephemeral rivers and reservoirs. Data that was collected by the VMS during each flood enabled direct calculation of the percolation  flow velocities and infiltration fluxes.

            <p>A vadose zone monitoring system that was installed under a gas station allowed accurate monitoring of the impact of remediation activities on the subsurface hydraulic and chemical conditions including: (1) temporal variation of the sediment water content, and (2) chemical and isotopic composition of the percolating water.

            <p>A study on enhance the biodegradation of perchlorate in the deep vadose zone was conducted through pilot scale experiment in a site that is heavily contaminated by perchlorate. Monitoring of the direct impact of enhanced percolation on the actual hydraulic and chemical conditions in the vadose zone was achieved using a vadose zone monitoring system (VMS) which measured continuously the vadose zone water content and allowed frequent sampling of the sediment pore water across the entire vadose zone of the site (40 m).</p>

          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Our disruptive technology enables detecting water percolation and contaminations migration, transport in the subsurface.
            We offer a new horizon in understanding the previously unseen subsurface below us. Our solutions to various fields provide a real time picture, cost and time efficient solutions for areas once based only on models or highly expensive less efficient testing.
            SenSoil’s VMSTM system  allows real time, continuous tracking of water percolation and contaminant transport process in deep sections of the Vadose zone (unsaturated sediments), from land surface to groundwater. It applied for detection, monitoring and optimization of remediation strategies, warning based continues monitoring of earthen dams moisture, monitoring and indicating of optimum growth conditions for agriculture and offers a substantial cost and efficiency improvement in Mine Heap Leaching process efficiency.
