            <strong>Minimization subsurface pollution</strong>
            depends on reliable and effective monitoring programs.
            Today, most groundwater monitoring programs are based on observation wells. Consequently, identification of
            pollutants in groundwater is clear evidence that contaminants already crossed the entire vadose-zone and
            accumulated in the aquifer. Unfortunately, only little can be done to fully remediate contaminated aquifers.
            Therefore effective monitoring program that aims at protecting groundwater from pollution must include vadose-zone
            monitoring technologies.

            Water infiltration through earthen dams may weaken
            its stability and potentially lead to dam breach. Today most monitoring programs
            in earthen dams are bases on measurement of the phreatic level in piezometers.
            Nevertheless detection of free water in well indicates undesired saturation of the dam sediment.

            Our disruptive technology enables detecting water percolation and contaminations migration, transport in the subsurface.
            We offer a new horizon in understanding the previously unseen subsurface below us. Our solutions to various fields provide a real time picture, cost and time efficient solutions for areas once based only on models or highly expensive less efficient testing.
            SenSoil’s VMSTM system  allows real time, continuous tracking of water percolation and contaminant transport process in deep sections of the Vadose zone (unsaturated sediments), from land surface to groundwater. It applied for detection, monitoring and optimization of remediation strategies, warning based continues monitoring of earthen dams moisture, monitoring and indicating of optimum growth conditions for agriculture and offers a substantial cost and efficiency improvement in Mine Heap Leaching process efficiency.
